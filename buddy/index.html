	<div class="quote">
		" Your school wants to strengthen the community by encouraging experienced students to connect with new students and help them adjust to campus life. Design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover each other. Consider the

	<div class="p-text">Being in IIT Bombay with around 10,000 students does makes one feel overwhelmed. Especially, for the freshmen batch, it's very easy to feel lost. IIT Bombay attempts to solve this through Student Mentorship Program (SMP). Being a mentor myself, I got excited to take on this particular prompt and design a solution for it. </div>
	<div class="head-1">Planning the task</div>
	<div class="p-text">Because of the 7 day time constraint, I decided to choose <span class="bold-blue">Google Venture's Design Sprint Framework</span>, with 1 phase per day and the last day for presentation.</div>

	<div class="subhead-1">Reframing</div>
	<div class="p-text">To better understand the problem statement, I tried to break it down into its core aims. This helped me to stay focus and avoid tempting distractions through the process.</div>
	<img src="assets/aim.png" alt="Core aims of the solution" class="img-cover" />
	<div class="img-caption">Core aims of the solution</div>
	<div class="focus-text-3"><span class="bold-blue">Discover</span> : How do we make mentors and mentees discover each other in a meaningful way ?</div>

	<div class="focus-text-3"><span class="bold-blue">Encourage</span> : How do we encourage the mentorship to sustain and help the mentees during freshmen year ?</div>
	<div class="subhead-1">Bias handling</div>
	<div class="p-text">Before I began, I wanted to make sure I don’t represent my personal biases. I noted down the possible reasons I might be biased during the design process.</div>
	<div class="p-text bold-blue">Possible reasons for bias -</div>
	<div class="list-elements">
		<li>I don’t speak Hindi - conversational language in Mumbai</li>
		<li>I am used to the hostel experience for over 5 years</li>
		<li>I had 10+ friends already studying in the campus</li>
		<li>I was pro-active about club activities</li>
		<li>I became a student mentor</li>
		<li>My mentees were from my own department</li>
		<li>My department functions quite differently from the others in the campus</li>
	</div>
	<div class="subhead-1">Research guidelines</div>
	<div class="p-text">To make sure that my assumptions and biases dont affect my research, I created a framework that would help me understand the things involved from scratch, to ensure that no detail is overlooked during primary and secondary
		reserach.</div>
	<img src="assets/questions.png" alt="Research framework" class="img-fit">
	<div class="img-caption">Research question (non-exhaustive list)</div>
	<div class="subhead-1">Understanding existing systems</div>
	<div class="p-text">To begin with, I wanted to understand the current system we have at IIT Bombay. The Student Mentor Program (SMP) has been setup for over several years and offers mentorship to the freshmen. Being a mentor myself, I knew the
		details, strengths and weaknesses of the system. However, I talked to some of my seniors and my heads to understand the system better.</div>
	<div class="p-text">The current system has two wings - Institute Student Mentorship Program (ISMP): for campus life and Department Academic Mentorship Program (DAMP): for academics. DAMP is for sophomores and seniors where as ISMP is for
		freshmen.</div>
	<img src="assets/smp.png" alt="Student Mentor Program's structure" class="img-fit">
	<div class="img-caption">Student Mentor Program's structure</div>
	<div class="p-text">A lot of resources needed by freshmen are put up online by various bodies, but in an inconsistent and haphazard way. This is due to the lack of coordination between the involved bodies. This results in a pretty messy online
		information system, that's both cluttered and hard to find.</div>
	<img src="assets/online.png" alt="Various online portals for freshmen" class="img-fit">
	<div class="img-caption">Various online portals available for freshmen</div>
	<div class="p-text">Based on the talks and interviews I had with other mentors and coordinators, I was able to identify the problems and bottlenecks in the current system, which I have discussed in the later sections.</div>
	<div class="subhead-1">User Interviews</div>
	<div class="p-text">To understand the user needs and frustrations, I had to perform Contextual Interviews. Since the freshmen has already been in the campus for a semester, it's not possible to interview
		them in the contextual setting. There are some of the efforts I made to make it as contextual yet casual and un-intrusive as possible.</div>
	<div class="list-elements">
		<li>Attending mentor-mentee meeting of other mentors</li>
		<li>Attending the DAMP Coordinator’s meeting</li>
		<li>Taking my mentee group for a pizza treat</li>
		<li>One-on-one discussions with my mentees</li>
		<li>Casual chat at the end of a club meet</li>
	</div>
	<img src="assets/demographic.png" alt="Demographic of the Interviews" class="img-fit">
	<div class="img-caption">Demographic of the Interviews</div>
	<div class="p-text">Altogether I was able to pack 17 interviews, some elaborate some short. The interview notes were put in a Google sheet, which were later used to derive pain points, user problems and insights.</div>
	<div class="page-break"></div>
	<div class="head-1">Phase 2 : <span class="blue">Problem Definition</span></div>
	<div class="subhead-1">Journey Mapping</div>
	<div class="p-text">Based on the insights I derived from the interviews, I created a journey map for both mentors and mentees. I was able to condense all the points and categorise them into pain points, insights and problem statements. It was
		later helpful in deciding on the features and define the scope of the solution.</div>
	<img src="assets/flow.png" alt="Journey map of a mentor" class="img-cover">
	<div class="img-caption">Journey map of a mentor</div>
	<div class="subhead-1">Actionable Insights</div>
	<div class="p-text">From the journey map, I extracted the core insights, which would guide through deciding the details of the solution. These actionable insights served as a framework to design the solution, hence keeping things concise.</div>
	<img src="assets/insights.png" alt="" class="img-large">
	<div class="subhead-1">User Personas</div>
	<div class="p-text">I created multiple user personas, based on the interviews. Going through the personas, helped me to identity the Primary Persona, to gear the product around and negative personas to stay away from filling the app with
		features.</div>
	<img src="assets/persona.png" alt="Primary personas" class="img-fit">
	<div class="img-caption">Primary Personas</div>
	<div class="subhead-1">Refined Problem Statement</div>
	<div class="p-text">Now after the interviews, joinery mapping and creating the personas, I had a good understand of the user needs. This means, I was able to frame the problem statement better and define the scope of the product.</div>
	<div class="focus-text-1 blue">Create a solution to help mentees discover mentors and an easy and effective way to ease the communication between them.</div>
	<div class="page-break"></div>
	<div class="head-1">Phase 3 : <span class="blue">Ideas Sketching</span></div>
	<div class="p-text">It was then time to start sketching. I started with a very loosely defined style and let it develop over multiple iterations. First, I sketched out the user flows, then moved to creating individual screens.</div>

	<div class="p-text">With the sketches ready, before I start to prototype, I wanted to create a simplified user flow and define the features and scope of the functionality. This flow structure helped me feel the various interaction between mentor

	<div class="head-1">Phase 6 : <span class="blue">Idea Validation</span></div>
	<div class="p-text">Due to time constraints, I wasn’t able to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the prototypes. However, in a very informal way, I had freshmen and mentors to navigate the app using an interactive prototype. I let them play around
		with the prototype and then asked them to perform a specific action. 6/7 times, they were able to be successful in doing soon their first attempt and 7/7 times they were able to perform within 3 attempts. This was a very crude way of testing,
		but this was the only possible course of action I was able to take due to time limitation.</div>
	<div class="head-1">Final Thoughts</div>
	<div class="p-text">I was able to complete most of the process with decent quality. However, I had to skip a lot of details in the documentation process due to the time limitation. If I had time, there are the things I would have liked to work
		on.</div>
	<div class="list-elements">
		<li>Perform a good validation process</li>
		<li>Integrate the mentor selection process within the app</li>
		<li>Design the onboarding screen</li>
		<li>Have better iconography</li>
		<li>Have comprehensive nudges to guide user actions</li>
		<li>Create an admin portal to keep track of mentor/mentee performances</li>
		<li class="bold-blue">Have the documentation more detailed and comprehensive</li>
	</div>
	<div class="head-1">Conclusion</div>
	<div class="p-text">To conclude, I had a lot of fun working on this task. The topic especially was very relatable, that made the talk more enjoyable. It was a good excise for me to go through the whole process and the time constraint meant, I couldn’t afford distractions and had to stick with the plan throughout. Although I couldn’t ensure that each process was as in depth as I wanted it to be, I was able to create a good enough solution in a week.</div>
	<div class="p-text">During the process, some of the mentors heard about the idea and the cabinet is now discussing to have such a system actually built for IITB. That would be cherry on the top!</div>
	<div class="p-text">Thank you for the opportunity and going through my project. I look forward for any kind of reviews and feedbacks is possible. Now its time to wait for the results :)</div>
