	<div class="focus-text-1">How do we encourage people to eat healthier and cooking easier in Indian households?</div>
	<div class="head-1">A need for better diet habits</div>
	<div class="p-text">Sensitivity towards food, nutritional requirements of a person is greatly decreasing day by day. Data released by WHO suggests that over the past 33 years, worldwide overweight and obesity rates among adults have increased by
		27.5%, while such rates among children have increased by 47.1%.</div>
	<div class="p-text">Our aim was to explore the possibilities to contribute to the betterment of sensitivity towards food, nutrition and diets in households in India using <span class="bold-orange">contextual research and design
			intervention.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="focus-text-2">"The whole act of cooking is a complex process of managing several simple tasks"</div>
	<div class="page-break"></div>
	<div class="page-title-2">The Solution</div>
	<div class="p-text">The App, using a person’s specific needs and preferences, considering a variety of factors creates a meal plan that's easy to follow and fully customisable.</div>
	<div class="focus-text-1 orange">Hotbox is an all in one tool for managing your every cooking need.</div>
	<img src="assets/showcase.jpg" alt="Hotbox - UI design" class="img-large" />
	<div class="focus-text-2 orange">Spotify is not just for listening to songs, it's for listenting to playlists. So is Hotbox, not just for dishes, but for your Meal Plans.</div>
	<div class="page-break"></div>
	<div class="page-title-2">Research</div>
	<div class="head-1">Contextual Interviews</div>
	<div class="p-text">To understand the dietary behaviour of households, we started our research with contextual interviews.</div>
	<img src="assets/map.jpg" alt="Interview locations" class="img-small" />
	<div class="img-caption">Interview locations</div>
	<div class="p-text">Our initial target users were <span class="bold-orange">anyone who cooks or manages cooking at home</span>. After a few interviews we redefined our target users as <span class="bold-orange">households with multiple members and
			working adults.</span></div>
	<div class="p-text">To prevent biases and avoiding missing out on details, we created a guideline to conduct interviews.</div>
	<ul class="list-elements">
		<li>Interviewing users when and where they cook</li>
		<li>Observing the user while they plan and cook</li>
		<li>Taking the role of an apprentice with the user, as a master</li>
	</ul>
	<img src="assets/interview-notes.jpg" alt="Interview Notes" class="img-cover" />
	<div class="img-caption">Notes from interviews</div>
	<img src="assets/flow.jpg" alt="Flow model" class="img-large" />
	<div class="head-1">Affinity Mapping</div>
	<div class="p-text">Interview notes offered us a good insight about each user’s dietary behaviour. But individuals tend to have biases and specific focus points and it is necessary to consolidate every perspective to see if there are patterns
		that emerge.</div>
	<img src="assets/affinity.jpg" alt="Affinity map" class="img-cover" />
	<div class="img-caption">Categorising interview notes</div>
	<div class="p-text">Each of the interview points were classified and color coded.</div>
	<ul class="list-elements">
		<li>User Statements</li>
		<li>Insights</li>
		<li>Contextual Inquiry</li>
		<li>Breakdown</li>
		<li>Design Intervention</li>
		<li>Follow-up Questions</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="p-text">The notes were then clubbed together based on similarity and causation. This helped in reducing about 450 notes into few categories that offered the essence of the collective insight.</div>
	<img src="assets/affinity-map.jpg" alt="Affinity map" class="img-cover" />
	<div class="img-caption">Building the affinity map bottom-up</div>
	<div class="p-text"> Any pattern identified is an area to work on. At this stage we got to see a broader perspective by connecting the dots from each observation and creating inferences. These inferences led to the development of meaningful
		insights that were invisible earlier.</div>
	<img src="assets/affinity-skeleton.jpg" alt="Affinity structure" class="img-large" />
	<div class="img-caption">Affinity structure ( simplified )</div>
	<div class="p-text">From the affinity maps, we were able to establish <span class="bold-orange">causation, intent </span> and other other dynamics involved in the act of cooking. We then extracted the top insights from affinity mapping, which
		helped us create a redefined design brief for our app.</div>
	<img src="assets/top-affinity.jpg" alt="Top Affinities" class="img-cover" />
	<div class="img-caption">Top Insights</div>
	<div class="head-1">Revised Design Brief</div>
	<div class="p-text">Helping people with <span class="bold-orange">time constraints, plan and follow personalised healthy, tasty and varied meals</span> for the entire family.</div>
	<div class="p-text">Problems to be solved:</div>
	<ul class="list-elements">
		<li>Reduce the cognitive load of planning a diet</li>
		<li>Time and resource optimisation</li>
		<li>Ensure a healthy and interesting diet</li>
		<li>Manage the kitchen inventory</li>
		<li>Track consumption and nutrition intake</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="head-1">Personas</div>
	<div class="p-text">When we bundled up all the problems faced by our user groups, they were quite varied and were from different sources. Injecting all these problems and behavioural patterns into a fictional character was needed, which basically
		meant creating personas. Not only does it help in finding out the ideal user for the proposed solution, but it also helps us focus on just the right problems to be solved and not get distracted.</div>
	<div class="p-text">We created narratives for multiple personas, detailing out different aspects of their lifestyle and dietary habits.</div>
	<img src="assets/persona-story.jpg" alt="Persona Stories" class="img-large" />
	<div class="img-caption">Persona stories</div>
	<div class="p-text">The personas created were then classified into</div>
	<ul class="list-elements">
		<li>Primary persona</li>
		<li>Secondary persona</li>
		<li>Supplementary persona</li>
		<li>Negative persona</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="p-text">The primary persona was chosen and detailed out to help us focus on the exact requirements.</div>
	<img src="assets/primary-persona.jpg" alt="Primary persona" class="img-fit" />
	<div class="img-caption">Primary persona</div>
	<div class="head-1">Scenarios</div>
	<div class="p-text">The next step was to imagine the scenarios of our primary persona and understand what exactly would our solution offer. This step helped us in coming up with features for the app.</div>
